# CoherentComposer

CoherentComposer is a text analysis tool currently in development, designed to extract contextually relevant information from datasets. Initially focused on atmospheric data related to Venus, this project has been enhanced to handle a broader range of topics, offering flexibility for various research and analytical applications in the future.

## Project Overview

CoherentComposer is built to identify and extract sentences or data points related to specified keywords across various domains, effectively parsing through datasets to locate the most pertinent information. This capability is intended for researchers, data scientists, and analysts who require targeted information extraction from vast text resources.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Extraction:** Capable of extracting relevant sentences that mention specific keywords or are related to certain topics using advanced NLP techniques.
- **Contextual Sensitivity:** Utilizes sophisticated methods to search not only for exact keyword matches but also for contextual relevance, thus capturing a broader spectrum of relevant data.
- **Adaptable Queries:** The tool can dynamically handle multiple sets of keywords across different domains, adapting to the needs of various analytical and research tasks.

## Current Status and Ongoing Development

- Basic functionality has been implemented using Python and SpaCy for text segmentation and data extraction.
- The tool is currently capable of handling a variety of topics, dynamically adapting to different keyword groups specified by the user.
- Enhancements to include semantic understanding for more contextually relevant outputs are in progress.

## Future Enhancements

- Further expand the query handling to dynamically accept and process data on any topic as specified by the user.
- Develop a user-friendly interface, potentially including web or graphical user interfaces for easier interaction.
- Increase the dataset handling capabilities to process larger and more complex datasets with higher efficiency.
- Generalize the system to adapt to various analytical needs beyond the initial focus.
- Utilize the extracted data to generate summaries, essays, or specialized reports tailored to specific subtopics. This functionality could be integrated into a comprehensive web platform, enhancing accessibility and application in fields requiring focused data analysis. Exact implementation details will be determined as development progresses.

## Installation and Usage

Installation instructions and usage guidelines for CoherentComposer will be provided upon completion of the project. This will ensure users can easily integrate and utilize the tool in their projects with the latest features and functionalities.
