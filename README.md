# CoherentComposer
CoherentComposer is a text analysis tool currently in development, designed to extract contextually relevant information from datasets, initially focused on atmospheric data related to Venus. This project aims to expand to handle a broader range of topics, offering flexibility for various research and analytical applications in the future.

## Features
- **Dynamic Data Extraction:** Capable of extracting relevant sentences that mention specific keywords or are related to certain topics using advanced NLP techniques.
- **Contextual Sensitivity:** Utilizes sophisticated methods to search not only for exact keyword matches but also for contextual relevance, thus capturing a broader spectrum of relevant data.
- **Adaptable Queries:** Currently focused on atmospheric data related to Venus, with plans to extend this to various domains.

## Current Status and Ongoing Development
- Basic functionality has been implemented using Python and SpaCy for text segmentation and data extraction.
- The tool is currently capable of analyzing atmospheric data with a particular focus on Venus.
- Enhancements to include semantic understanding for more contextually relevant outputs are in progress.
---
## Future Enhancements
- Expand the query handling to dynamically accept and process data on any topic as specified by the user.
- Develop a user-friendly interface, potentially including web or graphical user interfaces for easier interaction.
- Increase the dataset handling capabilities to process larger and more complex datasets with higher efficiency.
- Generalize the system to adapt to various analytical needs beyond the initial focus.
