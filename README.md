# CoherentComposer
CoherentComposer is a text analysis tool currently in development, designed to extract contextually relevant information from datasets, initially focused on atmospheric data related to Venus. This project aims to expand to handle a broader range of topics, offering flexibility for various research and analytical applications in the future.

## Project Overview
CoherentComposer is built to identify and extract sentences or data points related to specific atmospheric topics, effectively parsing through datasets to locate the most pertinent information. This capability is intended for researchers, data scientists, and analysts who require targeted information extraction from vast text resources.

## Features
- **Dynamic Data Extraction:** Capable of extracting relevant sentences that mention specific keywords or are related to certain topics using advanced NLP techniques.
- **Contextual Sensitivity:** Utilizes sophisticated methods to search not only for exact keyword matches but also for contextual relevance, thus capturing a broader spectrum of relevant data.
- **Adaptable Queries:** Currently focused on atmospheric data related to Venus, with plans to extend this to various domains.

## Current Status and Ongoing Development
- Basic functionality has been implemented using Python and SpaCy for text segmentation and data extraction.
- The tool is currently capable of analyzing atmospheric data with a particular focus on Venus.
- Enhancements to include semantic understanding for more contextually relevant outputs are in progress.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the query handling to dynamically accept and process data on any topic as specified by the user.
- Develop a user-friendly interface, potentially including web or graphical user interfaces for easier interaction.
- Increase the dataset handling capabilities to process larger and more complex datasets with higher efficiency.
- Generalize the system to adapt to various analytical needs beyond the initial focus.

## Installation and Usage
Installation instructions and usage guidelines for CoherentComposer will be provided upon completion of the project. This will ensure users can easily integrate and utilize the tool in their projects with the latest features and functionalities.

## Contributions
We are not actively seeking contributions at this time as the project is currently in its developmental phase. However, we are open to suggestions for expansion and improvements. If you have ideas or enhancements that you believe could benefit CoherentComposer, please feel free to share them. We appreciate your interest and input.
